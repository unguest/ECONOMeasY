## I. Description :
This is a firefox addon allowing during Moodle quizzes *(knowing the questions present in the question bank)* to display the answers directly on the test

**DISCLAIMER** : This does not replace the real knowledge that should normally be acquired but allows you to maximize your mark *(if you ever notice as it was the case for us, that the questions during the optional tests were drawn from the same database as that of the marked tests)*, I would not be responsible for your lack of knowledge on the module.

## II. Demo :
**What appears in yellow is added by the script**, you can then choose the correct answer
